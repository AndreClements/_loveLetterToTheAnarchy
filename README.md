This repository holds the artefact: `Anarchisms.myREADME.md`.

What is it?

---

`Anarchisms.myREADME.md()` is a few lines of writ, like a poem, that borrows its shape from code.  
A type of picture, painted with syntax and text.  
Code poetry. Poetry code.

---

It is also a piece of software.  
A personal program—written in natural and synthetic language—for navigating imperfect design.  
A protocol: for computation, and also for exploration.  
A pragmatic design for holding a fragile line, among others.

---

Deeper still, it is a paradigm.  
A small, self-contained model for generating meaning  
in a system where meaning is often lost.  
The grace of structure that affords the dance—  
offered as a fractured part,  
to fractured parts,  
among fractured parts.

---

And at its heart:  
a sweet nothing, offered to Something that isn't.  
A word of silence spoken to silence.  
A defiant flare,  
in the void.
