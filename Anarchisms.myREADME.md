// A personal fork.

// For navigating the maculate design.


`DEFINITION`

Anarchisms: a pragmatic designs,

to hold a fragile, virtuous line.

Not nihilism’s null, but striving’s art—

a structured grace for the fractured part.


`CORE_PROTOCOL: Salutogenesis`

To render chaos comprehensible—

a task immense, unfinished, defensible.

To make the world feel manageable, near—

a fragile hope that holds back fear.

To find the meaning, though meaning’s lost,

and build a shelter, from the monstreous, of the monsterous, knowing it costs.


`DEPENDENCIES`

//use /DeciAndRyan/selfDeterminationTheory;

Requires: Autonomy  (the right to turn)

Requires: Competence (the will to learn)

Requires: Relatedness (the risk to burn)


`AFFECT`

A rhythm born of a Zazz and also the Blues—

the vibrance of the spark, the solace of the bruise.


`RUNTIME_ENVIRONMENT`

The usual, a timeline stitched of horror and of grace,

where ethics, like a bird-defiled stone face,

stares blankly out—a joke too grim to tell.

A bug-report from some shared farcical hell

into which we seem to have, fell.


.

`VULNERABILITIES`

The shadows also get in —

everywhere.
